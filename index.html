			Hello, thank you for visiting my website. My name is Edgar Ramos and I am a Web Developer who recently completed a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Southern Methodist University. I became very interested in the field after the completion of a Web Design certificate also at SMU. I found myself very interested in all the different topics taught especially in the User Experience component which I consider critical in the success of an application. Once I participated in the Big Design conference in Addision, Tx; I could realize that this is the field I want to be part of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I consider teamwork a very important part of my work, since I truly believe that big tasks are achieved only through the cooperation and commitment of all the members looking to reach a common goal. It really motivates me to see myself working in a diverse team of bright people, sharing ideas and creating applications that can improve the life of society.
